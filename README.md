# Younglabs Inovation Assignment

This Frontend Project is made by using React JS and Javscript. All the good practices are implemented while making this App.
<br>
<br>

## Practices:-

1) Proper folder structure is used to isolate all the components.
2) For Components and Pages files, .jsx extension is used, so that we can separate components and fom other JS Files.
3) Modular SCSS is used, so that no style classes overlap with each other.
4) Each component folder is named after individual component and further each file contains.
  - ComponentName.jsx
  - ComponentName.module.scss

<br>

## Code Structure :-

[src](/src/) folder contains all the main files and folder

Further [src](/src/) folder is divided into sub-sections :-

1) [App](src/App.js) :- It is the main file which contains all the routes.

2) [Components](/src/components/) => It contains all the components that are required.
 - [Card](/src/components/Card/)
 - [Navbar](/src/components/Navbar/)
 - [SelectedCard](/src/components/SelectedCard/)

# How to build and run the code

1) To run the code on the local environment use the command :- `npm start`
2) To build the react app use command :- `npm run build`
3) And, then npm start to start the build app.
